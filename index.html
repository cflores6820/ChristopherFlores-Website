        <br><br>
        Christopher Flores is a fourth year Business Economics major attending the University of California, Riverside (UCR). He was part of the Alliance Marc and Eva Stern Math and Science School Class of 2016 and will be joining the UCR Class of 2020 in June. Chris has always been part of organizations and events that provide the opportunity to give back to the community, whether that be helping the homeless in Downtown Los Angeles or being a referee for AYSO and make sure these young passionate soccer fans enjoy the sport just as Chris did when he was younger.
	      <br><br>
	      Chris currently attends his second to last quarter at UCR as he is finishing the last bit of his degree. On the weekends, he takes the opportunity to work at Club Demonstration Services (CDS) which provides the necessities and allows for an apt schedule that balances work and school. Chris has been working at CDS for a little under 9 months as he sells different products and items to provide customers with clear communication and information about the product. Ranging from small demos to large continuous demos, Chris has gained the experience of talking with a large range of customers that has allowed him to learn the necessity of quick decision-making and adaptability.
        <br><br>
        Aside from works and academics, Chris enjoys using every opportunity to meet up with friends and socialize doing both outdoor activities to take a break from the world of technology while other times embracing it with the enjoyment of video games or enjoying a great film. From playing a friendly scrimmage of soccer to hiking up to the highest point of Griffith Park, outdoor adventures are a must. 
	      <br><br>
	      Like many others, Chris uses his life experiences and mistakes to not only move forward but use those mistakes and lessons to take the next step. With an intense 8 years of hard work and dedication to his degree, a year without adversity was practically inevitable. What Chris may lack in experience in the field of economics he makes up in perseverance, versatile decision-making, and most importantly passion. Passion not only for his work, but to succeed in what life throws at him not just for himself, but for the loved ones and people who have helped him reach the lengths he has.
